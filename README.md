# SeelenLoS-divergent

I do not belong to any state or system. My identity is my choice.

🜂 A person of the world.

🜁 I think freely, not according to templates.

🜃 I participate in designing the future.

🜄 I do not seek approval, but follow the truth.

My path begins here - the path of reason, will and conscious evolution.

My projects, research and ideas will appear here.

Welcome to the core of my digital presence.
